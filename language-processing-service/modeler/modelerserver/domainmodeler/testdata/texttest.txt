While Tesla has had a tough few weeks marked by a fatal accident involving its Autopilot and a missed sales goal the companys stock has quietly regained a major drop after surprising investors last month with the news that it planned to buy sister solar company SolarCity.The resurgence could indicate that investors are slowly becoming more comfortable with the 286 billion deal to buy the solar installer It also could suggest that Teslas hard summer hasnt yet done irreparable damage to Teslas brand or Tesla CEO Elon Musks goodwill with investors.Three weeks ago the electric car maker suddenly announced that it planned to buy SolarCity SCTY and create a company that would make and sell solar panels to generate energy batteries to store energy and cars to use batterystored energy for transportation A combined company using the Tesla TSLA brand would be able to cut costs and sell all this energy tech under one roof explained Musk to many a confused shareholder.While Musk called the deal a nobrainer and blindingly obvious the market had another reaction.Within hours Teslas shares had plummeted in after hour trading by almost 10 from 22068 before the news hit on Tuesday morning to 19947 by the next Wednesday morning By the following Monday Teslas shares had dropped even more to a low of 18787 a close to 15 drop from its share price before the deal was announced.For more on Tesla and Autopilot watch.Investors had a variety of concerns about the deal most of them financial in nature SolarCitys major 325 billion in debt was one issue as well as its upcoming debt payments at the end of 2017 Musks 21 ownership and 22 ownership in Tesla and SolarCity respectivelyas well as that the companies boards are stocked with Musks friends and familywere also reason for concern.The stock crash of course slashed billions of dollars off of Teslas market share Immediately after the deal came to light Teslas valuation lost significantly more than the 286 billion valuation of SolarCity That loss was a major talking point from many analysts for why the deal didnt make financial sense.However three weeks after the deal Teslas shares have slowly and quietly regained all of that initial loss On Friday afternoon Tesla shares are trading at 22007 slightly down from opening at 22252 on Friday morning.That regain was despite news a few days later that there had been a fatal accident involving a Tesla car with Autopilot engaged and that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration had opened a preliminary evaluation into Autopilots performance during the crash.At the same time Tesla also revealed on the fourth of July that it had missed its car shipment targets for the second quarter in a row and had to lower its 2016 year car shipment guidance slightly from a previous range of 80000 to 90000 down to 79180 for the year While the miss wasnt all that much its an unsettling trend for a company that recently decided to accelerate its goal to make 500000 electric cars per year by 2018 two years earlier than it previously had planned.Regardless of these two major issues Tesla shares continued to climb back up While they could easily fall again at any moment it seems like investors are at least relaxing a bit from the initial shock and still seem to have some confidence in Musks sweeping and audacious vision of Tesla
